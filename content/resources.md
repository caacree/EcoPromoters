### Additional Resources

For additional information on genetic regulation in *E. coli* please explore the following resources:

[EcoCyc](https://ecocyc.org/) - Literature-based curation of the E. coli genome, and of transcriptional regulation, transporters, and metabolic pathways.

[EcoliWiki](https://ecoliwiki.org/colipedia/index.php/Welcome_to_EcoliWiki) - EcoliWiki is a resource of community-generated pages about
everything related to non-pathogenic *E. coli*, its phages, plasmids, and mobile genetic elements

[RegulonDB](http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) - The primary database on transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12 containing knowledge manually curated from original scientific publications, complemented with high throughput datasets and comprehensive computational predictions.

[Deciphering promoters using SortSeq *Interactive Figure*](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/RNAseq_SortSeq/interactive_a) - This website provides interactive figures of information footprints, energy matrices and regulatory cartoons for many *E. coli* promoters and growth conditions.
